# Consider the graph G = (V, E) formed letting:
# - V = {me and the people I'm Facebook friends with}
# - E = {(u, v): u and v are Facebook friends}
# 
# I want to determine the cardinality of the maximum independent set in G,
# and possibly find a maximum set. This problem is NP-hard, so an 
# approximation will most likely be used.
